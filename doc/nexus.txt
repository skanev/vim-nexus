*nexus.txt* tmux and vim, sitting in a tree...

An opinionated plugin for getting vim and tmux to play together.

INTRODUCTION                                            *nexus*

This plugin represents its author's view on workflow. It is a collection of
various small things that bring together tmux and vim for a smooth coding
experience.

When I work, I always have a GUI Vim (MacVim, to be precise) and a terminal
open. I want to achieve a workflow, where the editor and the shell know about
each other and integrate smoothly.

                                                        *nexus-current-session*
Nexus expects a running tmux session named like the current directory, that
has a window named "nexus". For example, if you are working on a project in:
>
    /work/projects/killer-app
<
Nexus will expect to have a session called "killer-app" with a window named
"nexus". It interfaces the terminal by sending commands like:
>
    tmux send-keys -t killer-app:nexus

FUNCTIONALITY                                           *nexus-functionality*

1. Run current file                                     |nexus-run|
2. Start a tmux shell                                   |nexus-start-tmux|

=============================================================================
1. Run current file                                     *nexus-run*

Executes the current file in the terminal. Currently supports only RSpec and
Cucumber.

<Plug>NexusRunFile        Execute the whole file.
                          In RSpec, it runs the whole spec. In Cucumber, it
                          runs the complete feature.

<Plug>NexusRunLine        Execute the context of the current line.
                          In RSpec, it runs the example the cursor is
                          currently in (using the --line option).
                          In Cucumber, it runs the scenario the cursor is
                          currently in.

2. Start a tmux shell                                   *nexus-start-tmux*

:Nexus                    Starts the tmux session nexus talks to.
                          If the session is already running, it prints a
                          warning. See also |nexus-current-session|
